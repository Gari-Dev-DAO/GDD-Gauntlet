# Deep Dive into Decentralized Social Graph

## What is a social graph?

The term “social graph” is similar to the social network. 

Simply said, a social graph is a representation of a person's relationships inside an online social network. It demonstrates how people, groups, and organizations are connected within a social network. For example, when a user register and creates an account on Facebook, posts content, follow his friends, then a finely organized feed is available in the user's profile by the algorithms. Every activity done on the app like commenting on post, liking pictures, following friends gets added in the social graph and feed will be curated based on the social graph. 

A very small social graph of user is shown below.

A user’s social graph can include their interests, choices, interpersonal relationships, and living habits. social graphs play a very important role in our social life. But currently, the big private organizations like Facebook, TikTok, Twitter etc. are controlling these social graphs.

## Benefits of social Graph:

Let’s see how the social graph benefits the social media platform, users and third parties.

### 1. For Social Media Platform

The more Social Media Platform knows about the users and their social graphs, the better they will enhance user's ad its feeds, and that will make more users attached to the Platform. The main benefit here is monetization. Social Media Platforms can leverage the user's data by selling it to the advertisers and third parties. 

### 2. For Users

Although the user’s data is at stake but using the social graph the algorithms will deliver a personalized experience to the user. User’s will only see the content that they like to watch. Also, the advertisements are targeted to the potential users only, so user’s see ads of things that they to buy.

### 3. For Third parties

Third parties can use the social graphs which includes advertisers, sellers, brands and companies. They target their potential customers or right audience and throw them personalized advertisements which increases the chances of them buying. For example, if someone read some trip reviews on Facebook, then tourist companies can target them and show them personalized trip package advertisements.

## The Era of socialization

Let's take a look how the internet and social media evolved over the time. In the beginning of 1990s, the first version of internet arrived. It was known as **Web 1.0.** It allowed to create static and basic websites which completely changed the way information was shared. But it was just one sided, means there was no interaction between the site publisher and readers. After this, the next version of internet was ready called Web 2.0. 

**Web 2.0** was more user focused which allowed interaction to happen two sided between both user and platform. Web 2.0 gave the idea of open digital economy and democratizing internet to the masses. Many big organizations benefitted from this web 2.0 which led to concentration of power. Some of them are Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube. Monetization was an important aspect of these web 2.0 platforms. They are technically free for the users but in reality, the user’s data is used as product for profits.   

![web1-vs-web2-vs-web3-1024x846.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1f74701e-ada9-4ff1-8439-574986847c0e/web1-vs-web2-vs-web3-1024x846.jpg)

The next version of internet which is currently getting build is **Web 3.0.** The foundation of Web 3.0 is built on blockchain technology also called the distributed ledger, which is decentralized, transparent, and unchangeable.

## ****Problems of web 2.0 social graph****

### ****Invasion of user privacy****

Normal users might not matter this, but the currently social media platforms are directly invading the user’s privacy. They sell the customer’s personal data to third parties and advertisers for profits. Social media giants earn billions of dollars each year from the advertisers which is almost a major part of total revenues.

### Centralized data storage and data leaks

Since the data is controlled centrally and so the user's data are stored in a centralized server. This gives the hackers the chance to exploit vulnerabilities and steal data. This has become a common thing now-a-day that millions of user's data are leaked in these centralized companies.

### ****Data Ownership****

The whole web2 social graph is controlled by the companies only. User’s gives all the permission during signup by opting “User Service Agreement” and” Privacy Policy”. This gives the giants the right to information, and they can anything with users and their data. The companies can even ban the user if they don’t follow their guidelines. 

## Way to Web3 social graph

The most important goal of the web3 social graph is to use decentralization and users the power to own their data. With the help of blockchain technology the power will lies in user’s hands and not with platforms. Users can choose what they want to do with data whether they want to give access to third parties or not. They can monetize their data by giving access to the advertisers. Also, users can completely transfer their on-chain data from one platform to another if they have some issues with any platform or the platforms gets banned.  

The web3 social graph is very much transparent also, users can see everything like whom they are interacting is visible in their wallets. The algorithms can't manipulate information easily in web 3 social graphs.

## Benefits of web3 social graph

Let us look all the ways in which web3 social graph is better than web2:

- ********************************Decentralization:******************************** Web3 social graphs are decentralized and are stored on a distributed ledger         between many nodes
- ************************Power distribution:************************ Web3 graphs doesn’t have any centralized authority and all the ownership are distributed to the end users.
- **Privacy:** The user’s data lies with users only and they can decide if they want to share the data with third parties or advertisers.
- **********************P2P Sharing:********************** Users can share their own social graph directly between them.
- **Freedom:** Web3 gives more freedom to users in choosing community, policies, applications etc.
- **Data** **transferability:** Users can transfer all their on-chain data from one platform to another without much difficulty. So, the data lives on forever, it doesn’t destroy if even the platform is stopped.

## Currently web3 social graph projects

Let's take a look on the projects which have been built using decentralized social graphs.

### 1. Mastodon

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8463e264-c860-42e9-bd96-f638020fb649/Untitled.png)

[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/about/more) is considered as an alternative to Twitter. Similar to Twitter, Mastodon enables users to publish, follow individuals and groups, as well as like and repost other people's content. Mastodon is not a single platform, despite supporting many of the same social networking functions as Twitter. Instead, it's a network of connected, independently run servers.

The interconnected Mastodon servers, along with other servers that can "talk" to Mastodon servers, are collectively dubbed the **"fediverse”**. Each server is regulated by rules established by the individuals who run it, which is a fundamental feature of the fediverse. You can consider fediverse as college and every Mastodon server resembles like the hostels of the college. 

***Policies***

Regarding policies, all the servers and websites running on Mastodon must adhere to the Mastodon Server Covenant, which requires them to actively combat hate speech, perform daily backups, have at least one emergency admin, and give three months' notice before shutting down their servers. Additionally, each server has its own set of guidelines or regulations, such as the need for certain tags on potentially sensitive information.

***Drawbacks***

There may be disadvantages to Mastodon's federated server approach. First of all, it can be difficult to discover a server to join on Mastodon, especially when a surge of people looking for servers’ results in the development of waitlists, and it's not always possible to identify the rules and values of the people operating a server.

Second, managing servers that increase with membership and activity presents substantial financial and technological problems. Mastodon users should be ready for membership fees, after the initial phase is gone. Server hosting expenses can reach hundreds of dollars per server each month.

### 2. Lens Protocol

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c4236323-41e5-45fa-9716-9ccf7758d134/Untitled.png)

The Lens Protocol is a Web3 social network on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake blockchain. It is intended to provide producers the ability to control the connections between themselves and their audience, creating a fully customizable, user-owned social network. The protocol is designed from the bottom up with flexibility in mind, enabling the addition of new features and fixes while preserving user-owned content and social connections.

The Lens Protocol is groundbreaking because it is permissionless and composable, allowing content creators to "very own their virtual roots" and enabling people to take ownership of the connections among themselves and groups without compromise. This is in contrast to Facebook or Twitter, which use social graphs to make interconnections among social community users only centrally.

***Working***

The project's utilization of a decentralized social network is its core component. The usage of a graph database (GDB) is typically used to create this. Data is stored in a GDB using graph structures, which have nodes, edges, and different characteristics. In other words, these graphs display the network's members as well as their connections.

A composable and open-source social graph is used by Lens Protocol. Creators wishing to launch their own social media network on web3 can utilize this without restriction. NFTs are used to represent user profiles. All of the profiles are stored in the Polygon PoS layer 2 solution. Also supported by the platform are wallets like Argent, Gnosis Safe, and MetaMask. This promotes cross-platform compatibility.

***Architecture***

The hub requires users to create a profile after which they get a sequentially ID'd profile NFT. The NFT holder is the owner and controls all things of profile.

*Modules* are very important in lens protocol. Module brings some customs functions to the system. The three modules in protocol are: 

- **Follow modules** represent the action of a user following another profile. Users set up their follow modules when creating their unique profiles. They follow a subscription model and are highly customizable.
- **Collect modules** is the one used for creating online articles.
- **Reference modules** exist for interacting with other users and commenting on their posts.

Profile owners can:

1. *Publish to the profile:* Publication types can be post, comments, and sharing content.
2. *Set the profile's "follow module":* This determines the logic to happen when someone follows your profile.

Regular wallets can:

1. *Follow profiles:* This executes the profile's "follow module" logic, if any.
2. *Collect publications:* This executes any logic in the publication's "collect module."

### 3. **Chingari**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/006a6dc3-6ddd-420e-921e-248ceaefd874/Untitled.png)

Chingari allows users to record and share videos with wide selection of filters and games. Users can find creators, download their videos, like, share, and communicate with the influencers/creators they most enjoy. It is the first community-based Web 3.0 application that is built on video creation.

Chingari Platform has own token called GARI. The business models used in Chingari are Create to Earn (C2E), Watch to Earn (W2E), Engage-2-earn that motivates the creators and users to earn GARI. Chingari considers the platform's creators to be its primary value generators. Being the first platform to treat influencer marketing like a business, it directly distributes 30% of its revenues to creators in the form of GARI Tokens. Simply said, consumers earn GARI tokens by viewing producers' content on Chingari, while creators earn GARI tokens by generating content for the platform.

GARI tokens are employed for a variety of tasks both within and outside of Chingari. GARI is used to run the GARI DAO and functions as an in-app money. 

### 4. Peertube

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c4e5fbb9-2df8-4979-a27c-e947291a32b0/Untitled.png)

PeerTube is a substitute for YouTube, with the exception that it is a decentralized social media network with rules, restrictions, and content warnings that are virtually identical to those of Mastodon. You may build a website that hosts videos using PeerTube software. PeerTube differs from YouTube in that it does not want to build a sizable platform that consolidates video on a single server. The idea behind PeerTube is to build a network of many little, linked video hosting companies. It is up to the creator to decide how to make money from it, whether it be through donations, social tokens, or NFTs.

***Advantages***

Since PeerTube is open source and distributed under a free license, users do not need to pay to install it on your server. It is transparent and auditable. Anyone's contribution can make it better. It is built on ActivityPub, which enables us to connect with any other website, just like Mastodon. The actual illustration is the fact that users of Mastodon may now use their Mastodon accounts to like or comment on films hosted on the PeerTube server. This means that there is excellent interoperability between them. PeerTube decentralizes control over video monetization and storage decisions. 

There are some things where Peertube needs improvements. Like each server gets only 20GB storage, but it again depends on different instances. Also, it faces some issues in Bandwidth when video gets viral.

## Conclusion

Web3's social network is essential in the current environment. The existing social network requires significant repair since social giants are abusing and exploiting user data. Web3 social graphs seem to provide a relief in this one-sided social graph exploitation. Web3 not only helps users own and own their data, but it also addresses other problems including the portability of data and security risks related to data. As a result, the introduction of the web3 social graph has the potential to completely reconstruct the ecosystem and make it functional.
